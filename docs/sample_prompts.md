# Example LLM Prompts for Workshop 2

Use these prompts to help you generate code, debug scripts, or adapt your workflow for large genome analysis and cluster computing.

---

## Downloading Large Data
```
I need to download a large ancient genome FASTA file from a public database (e.g., AADR or NCBI). Please generate Python code to do this efficiently and save the file to a specific location.
```

## Efficient Sequence Analysis
```
How can I process a large FASTA file (>100M bp) in Python to compute sequence length and GC content without loading the entire file into memory?
```

## Cluster Job Submission
```
Please provide an example qsub script to run my Python analysis on a compute cluster. The script should specify resources and handle output files.
```

## Debugging and Troubleshooting
```
I'm getting a memory error when analyzing a large FASTA file. How can I adapt my code or cluster job to avoid this?
```
